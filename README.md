# General considerations

## project name
The name 'okchakko' comes from the endangered choctaw language and refers to a pale green or blue: there is no word for 'blue' or 'green' in the choctaw language but only 'okchamali', which refers to a vivid green or blue, and 'okchakko', which designates a pale green or blue. This emphasises that the taxonomies of colour in human languages are not identical, and reflects the cognitive diversity that characterises them.

As William Poundstone (*Labyrinths of reason*, 1989) emphasizes: 'A jeweler examines an emerald. “Aha,” he says, “another green emerald. In all my years in this business, I must have seen thousands of emeralds, and every one has been green.” We think the jeweler reasonable to hypothesize that all emeralds are green. Next door is another jeweler having equally comprehensive experience with emeralds. He speaks only the Choctaw Indian language. Color distinctions are not as universal as might be thought. The Choctaw Indians made no distinction between green and blue—the same words applied to both. The Choctaws did make a linguistic distinction between okchamali, a vivid green or blue, and okchakko, a pale green or blue. The Choctaw-speaking jeweler says: All emeralds are okchamali. He maintains that all his years in the jewelry business confirm this hypothesis.' 
## priority pairs
With regard to endangered languages, priority pairs are the most wanted translation pairs for a given endangered language, in keeping with the main language with which it is associated (on a diglossia relationship). To take an example: French-Corsican is the priority pair for Corsican language. In the same way, Italian-Gallurese is the priority pair for Gallurese language, etc. Now expanding on that idea, priority pairs are: 

- Corsican: (i) French-Corsican (ii) Italian-Corsican (iii) English-Corsican
- Sardinian Gallurese: (i) Italian-Gallurese (ii) English-Gallurese
- Sardinian Sassarese: (i) Italian- Sassarese (ii) English-Sassarese
- Sardinian Logodurese: (i) Italian-Logodurese (ii) English-Logodurese
- Sicilian: (i) Italian- Sicilian (ii) English-Sicilian
- Manx: (i) English-Manx
- Munegascu: (i) French-Munegascu (ii) Italian-Munegascu (iii) English-Munegascu

## conditions for a given endangered language to be a candidate for this project
What are the conditions for a given endangered language to be a candidate for this project? Ideally, one should have:
- a dictionary: some specialized lexicons are useful too
- a list of locutions and their translation: to be more accurate what is needed are noun locutions, adjective locutions, adverbial locutions, verbal locutions and their translations in other language.
- a detailed grammar (in any language): ideally, the grammar should be very detailed, mentioning notably irregular verbs, noun plurals, etc. Subjonctive, conditional tenses must also be accurately described.
- in addition, elision rules, euphony rules, should also be described.
- most importantly: a description of the main variants of the language and their differences. This is needed to handle the ‘variant problem’ : as an effect of diversity, endangered languages are often polynomic in nature and come with variants.

But the target concerns all languages and these conditions can be added incrementally

# Multilingual dictionary
The aim of this project is to create a multilingual dictionary. The relevant languages are major languages and endangered languages. To begin with, we shall focus on the italian-gallurese, italian-sassarese, italian-logudorese, italian-campidanese, italian-sicilian pairs.
The dictionary is understood here in an extended sense. It includes:
- common nouns, proper nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, etc.
- noun locutions, adjectival locutions, verbal locutions, adverbial locutions, etc.

The multilingual dictionary will be the source for the bilingual and unilingual dictionaries.

## file structure
For the sake of simplicity, the dictionary format will be .csv. Each language will have several dedicated columns:
- word: fre, ita, sdn for (respectively) french, italian and gallurese words
- grammatical type: freT, itaT, sdnT for (respectively) french, italian and gallurese grammatical types
- rule type: freR, itaR, sdnR for (respectively) french, italian and gallurese rule types: this item is used used to compute plurals of nouns or adjectives, as well as conjugated forms of verbs. 

## grammatical typology
<img align="right" width="25%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/British_and_European_butterflies_and_moths_%28Macrolepidoptera%29_%28Plate_XII%29_%286466293519%29.jpg/600px-British_and_European_butterflies_and_moths_%28Macrolepidoptera%29_%28Plate_XII%29_%286466293519%29.jpg">

The multilingual dictionary will only contain lemmas (derived forms will be computed lately). The main grammatical types are:
- masculine singular common nouns : NCms
- feminine singular common nouns : NCfs
- masculine singular proper nouns: NPms
- feminine singular proper nouns: NPfs
- masculine singular adjectives : AQms
- infinitive verbs: INF
- adverbs: ADV
- prepositions: PS

## multiple grammatical types
Some words have different grammatical types. For example, 'cardinale' in Italian (and 'cardinal' in French) can be both a common noun (NCms) and an adjective (AQms). This results in two entries in the multilingual dictionary:
- cardinale, NCms
- cardinale, AQms

## language codes
The codes used to name each language are those from the iso 639-2 standard. These three-letter codes are included in the iso 639-2_codes file (see [List of ISO 639-2 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes) and also https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php). For example:
- ita: Italian language
- sdn: Gallurese language

## derived dictionaries
From the multilingual dictionary, we will be in a position to compute:
- a monolingual dictionary for each language concerned
- a bilingual dictionary for each pair of languages concerned

## primary target
Our primary target will be the italian-gallurese, italian-sassarese, italian-loudorese, italian-campidanese, italian-sicilian pairs and thus the associated translation.

### Gallurese language
- iso 639-2 code: sdn 
<img align="right" width="40%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Santa_Teresa_Gallura_-_Capo_Testa_%2818%29.JPG/512px-Santa_Teresa_Gallura_-_Capo_Testa_%2818%29.JPG">
The Gallurese language is one of the four languages (along with Sassarese, Logudorese and Campidanese) which belongs to the macro-language of Sardinia. The Gallurese language belongs to the Italo-Dalmatian family and is spoken in the region of Gallura, northeastern Sardinia. Gallurese morphology and vocabulary are close to southern Corsican, especially the 'sartinese' variant, whereas its phonology and syntax are similar to those of other Sardinian languages. One third of Gallurese vocabulary is also influenced by Logudorese Sardinian, Catalan, and Spanish (adapted from wikipedia article).

In a first step, we will implement one of the main variants of the Gallurese language (we will preferably choose a well documented variant, such as the one used in the writings of Maria Teresa Inzaina). Later on, the main variants of the Galluese language will have to be integrated. 

The mode of writing in Gallurese will be that which appears in the writings of Maria Teresa Inzaina:

- [Tizzoni](https://www.luigiladu.it/contos/tizzoni.htm), a short story of Maria Teresa Inzaina and Antonio Meloni
- [Li fiori di l’alburi di la presca](http://www.accademiasarda.it/2014/12/li-fiori-di-lalburi-di-la-presca-di-maria-teresa-inzaina/), short story of Maria Teresa Inzaina
- [La fura](https://www.luigiladu.it/contos/la_fura.htm), short story of Maria Teresa Inzaina
- [Tummeantoni (l’ultimu carrulanti)](https://www.luigiladu.it/contos/tummeantoni.htm), short story of Maria Teresa Inzaina
    
### Sassarese language
- iso 639-2 code: sdc

### Logudorese language
- iso 639-2 code: src 

### Campidanese language
- iso 639-2 code: sro 

### Sicilian language
- iso 639-2 code: scn 

## evolution
Lately, further columns will be added for each language:
- lemma: for derived words
- rule: how to generate plural or conjugated forms of verbs

# Bilingual-dictionaries
There exists priority translation pairs, from the standpoint of endangered languages. Such notion of a priority pair (the most useful pair for the current users of the endangered language), regarding a given endangered language. For example, French to Corsican is a priority pair, with respect to other pairs suchas Gallurese-Corsican, English-Corsican or Spanish-Corsican. In this context, any endangered language has its own priority pair. For example, a priority pair for sardinian gallurese is Italian-Gallurese. In the same way, a priority pair for sardinian sassarese is Italian-Sassarese. In an analogous way, a priority pair for sicilian language is Italian-Sicilian.

Let us discuss the question of priority pairs with regard to endangered languages. It consists of the most wanted translation pairs for a given endangered language, in keeping with the main language with which it is associated. To take an example: French-Corsican is the priority pair for Corsican language. In the same way, Italian-Gallurese is the priority pair for Gallurese language, etc. Now expanding on that idea, priority pairs are:

- Corsican: (i) French-Corsican (ii) Italian-Corsican (iii) English-Corsican
- Sardinian Gallurese: (i) Italian-Gallurese (ii) English-Gallurese
- Sardinian Sassarese: (i) Italian- Sassarese (ii) English-Sassarese
- Sardinian Logodurese: (i) Italian-Logodurese (ii) English-Logodurese
- Sicilian: (i) Italian- Sicilian (ii) English-Sicilian
- Manx: (i) English-Manx
- Munegascu: (i) French-Munegascu (ii) Italian-Munegascu (iii) English-Munegascu

Pairs such as French to Gallurese, French to Sassarese, English to Gallurese, English to Sassarese, English to Sicilian do not have priority, as they can be resolved using an intermediate pair. French to Gallurese is done with the French to Italian pair (e.g. with Deepl) and then with the Italian to Gallurese pair, etc.

The bilingual dictionaries are understood here in an extended sense. They include:
- common nouns, proper nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, etc.
- noun locutions, adjectival locutions, verbal locutions, adverbial locutions, etc.

Bilingual dictionaries will be computed automatically from the multilingual dictionary.

# Unilingual dictionaries
The unilingual dictionaries are understood here in an extended sense. They include:
- common nouns, proper nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, etc.
- noun locutions, adjectival locutions, verbal locutions, adverbial locutions, etc.

Unilingual dictionaries will be calculated automatically from the multilingual dictionary.
